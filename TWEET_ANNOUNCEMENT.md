🚀 Introducing s402 - HTTP-402 Payments for @SeiNetwork!

We've adapted @coinbase's brilliant x402 protocol for Sei's blazing-fast EVM.

One line of code. Real micropayments. No BS.

✅ ~2 second settlements
✅ $0.001 minimum 
✅ Native USDC
✅ MIT licensed

### Tweet 2 - Attribution
```
First, respect to @coinbase for creating x402 🙏

They built the protocol that makes HTTP payments dead simple. We just optimized it for @SeiNetwork's parallel EVM.

The genius is theirs. We're standing on giants' shoulders.

### Tweet 3 - Why Sei?
```
Why Sei? Because it's BUILT for this:

⚡ Parallel processing = concurrent payments
⚡ Native USDC = no bridges, no wrapping  
⚡ Sub-second finality = instant verification
⚡ Low fees = true micropayments work

Sei isn't just fast. It's PURPOSE-BUILT for payments.
```

### Tweet 4 - For Developers
```
Developers, this is REAL:

```js
app.use(paymentMiddleware("0xYourAddress", {
  "/api/data": "0.001" // $0.001 USDC
}));
```

That's it. Your API now accepts payments.

No payment processors. No 3% fees. No minimums.

Just code.

We need builders, not spectators.

Fork it. Break it. Make it better.

First 10 projects to integrate s402 get:
- Direct support from us
- Feature in our docs
- Potential Sei ecosystem grants

Let's make payments invisible.

Launching s402: Bringing HTTP-402 Payments to Sei Network

Today, we're releasing s402 - an adaptation of Coinbase's x402 protocol optimized for Sei's high-performance EVM.

What it does:
• Enables micropayments on any HTTP endpoint
• Processes payments in ~2 seconds
• Supports payments as low as $0.001 USDC
• Integrates with one line of code

Why it matters:
The internet has always lacked native payments. Credit cards have high minimums and fees. Crypto has been too complex. s402 changes this by making payments as simple as HTTP headers.

Technical highlights:
• Uses EIP-3009 for gasless transfers
• Leverages Sei's parallel processing
• Native USDC support (no bridges)
• Fully open source (MIT license)

This isn't revolutionary - we built on Coinbase's excellent x402 protocol. We simply optimized it for Sei's unique capabilities.

For developers: Integration takes about 30 minutes. Not 30 seconds like some claim, but actually 30 minutes. We believe in honest marketing.

Title: We adapted Coinbase's x402 payment protocol for Sei Network - introducing s402

Hey everyone,

We've been working on bringing HTTP-402 payments to Sei Network. For those unfamiliar, HTTP-402 is the "Payment Required" status code that's been in the spec since forever but never had a good implementation.

Coinbase created x402 - a brilliant protocol for adding payments to any HTTP endpoint. We studied it, learned from it, and adapted it specifically for Sei's capabilities.

What makes this interesting:
- Sei's parallel EVM processes payments concurrently
- ~2 second settlement (Sei's actual speed, not marketing BS)
- Native USDC support means no wrapping or bridges
- Minimum payment of $0.001 actually works

The integration is genuinely simple:
```javascript
app.use(paymentMiddleware("0xYourAddress", {
  "/api/data": "0.001" // $0.001 USDC
}));
```

That's it. Your endpoint now requires payment.

We're not claiming to have invented anything. Coinbase did the hard work with x402. We just made it work really well on Sei.

Everything is open source: https://github.com/Sigmabrogz/sei402

Happy to answer questions or take feedback. We built this because we needed it, figured others might too.
